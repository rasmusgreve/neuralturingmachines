  What is it? 
  -----------
  
  ANJI (Another NEAT Java Implementation) 
  Built on top of existing OpenSource projects, ANJI is an implementation of NEAT 
  (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies), an algorithm for evolving artificial 
  neural networks developed by Kenneth Stanley, working in the Neural Networks 
  Research Group at the University of Texas at Austin.
  
  NEAT evolves both the connection weights and architecture of neural networks by 
  starting with minimal topologies and adding innovations each generation through 
  crossover and three types of mutations (changing the weight of an existing 
  connection, adding a new connection, and adding a new neuron). For more 
  information about NEAT, please click on the NEAT logo above to visit the NEAT 
  Users Page. 

  Much of the evolutionary computing aspects are implemented using JGAP (Java 
  Genetic Algorithms Package).
