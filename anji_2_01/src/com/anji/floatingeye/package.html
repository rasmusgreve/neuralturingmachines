<code>com.anji.floatingeye</code> contains classes to build and operate a 
"floating eye" which is an agent that can move up and down, left and right, and zoom 
in and out relative to an image, or "surface".  The artificial retina is a 2x2 array 
of pixels that is updated based on the state of the surface and the position of the 
retina.<br/>
The central class of this package is <code>coma.anji.FloatingEye</code>.  It is meant 
to identify an image as containing some target feature (e.g., its purpose might be to 
identify a square when presented with several different shapes).  It outputs an
affinity, a <code>double</code>code> between 0 and 1 identifying level of confidence
that the image contains the target feature.<br/>
A floating eye's input values are stored in <code>com.anji.nn.Neuron</code> objects.
A floating eye does not necessarily need to be controlled via an artificial neural
network (see <code>com.anji.floatingeye.test.FloatingEyeTestDriver</code> for a 
non-ANN example), but it was built primarily to be integrated with a 
<code>com.anji.nn.AnjiNet</code> object via 
<code>com.anji.floatingeye.AnjiNetFloatingEye</code>.<br/>
