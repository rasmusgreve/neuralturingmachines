<code>com.anji.polebalance</code> contains classes to implement pole balancing.  The
goal of a pole balancing agent is to move a virtual cart back and forth on a 
2-dimensional track, keeping 1 or 2 poles (the bottom of each is attached to a hinge
in the center of the cart) balanced vertically.<br/>
These implementations are shameless copies of work done by

and <a href="http://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/">Colin Green</a>.<br/>
