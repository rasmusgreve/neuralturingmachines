<code>com.anji.run</code> contains classes concerned with an evolutionary run.  A
population is a genetically isolated set of chromosomes that may be evolved over
multiple runs.  All members of a population are built for a certain domain (the 
problem they are trying to solve) and representation (the phenotype of the 
chromosomes).<br/>
Domain, population, and representation objects are not yet used.<br/>
