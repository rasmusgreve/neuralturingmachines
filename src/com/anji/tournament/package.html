<code>com.anji.tournament</code> contains classes to handle tournaments and games.  
A <code>Tournament</code> is a series of matches between a population of 
<code>Player</code> objects, where the particular tournament logic determines who 
plays whom, and how many times.  A <code>Game</code> is an individual contest between 
two players.  <code>Game</code> and <code>IteratedGame</code> form a 
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2002/jw-0913-designpatterns.html">composite</a> 
design pattern.  An <code>IteratedGame</code> might represent a match, or a series of
trials, or any hierarchy of contests and sub-contests.  
<code>TournamentFitnessFunction</code> ties this all to the genetic algorithm 
framework.
