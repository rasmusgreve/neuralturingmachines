<code>com.anji.roshambo</code> contains classes to implement the game of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roshambo">roshambo</a>, also commonly known as 
rock-scissors-paper.  Most of these classes came from the 
<a href="http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/~donkers/games/roshambo03/">2003 Computer Roshambo</a> 
competition.  A <code>com.anji.roshambo.AnjiNetRoshamboPlayer</code> object has an
artificial neural network controlling such a player.  It meets the specifications 
required of the tournament, although it was never entered.<br/>
